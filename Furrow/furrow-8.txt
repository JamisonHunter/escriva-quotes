The Lord’s calling ﻿—﻿ vocation ﻿—﻿ always presents itself like this: “If any man would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.”
Yes: a vocation demands self-denial, sacrifice. But how pleasant that sacrifice turns out to be ﻿—﻿ gaudium cum pace, joy and peace ﻿—﻿ if that self-giving is complete!
