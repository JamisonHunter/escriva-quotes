459
Will the Lord return and enkindle my soul? Your head assures you that He will come and so, deep down, does a faint sense of longing which is perhaps hope. On the other hand, your heart and will (too much of the former and too little of the latter) cast a paralysing and deadly melancholy over everything, like a sneer of bitter mockery.
Listen to the promise of the Holy Spirit: “Within a very short time, He who has to come will come and will not delay. In the meantime, the just man lives by faith.”
