You can never give advice dispassionately or with a right intention, if you get upset or think people show a lack of confidence in you when they also listen to the advice of other people of proven formation and good doctrine.
﻿—﻿If you are really interested, as you claim, in the good of souls and in stating the truth, why are you offended?
