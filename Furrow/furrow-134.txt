We have to foster in our souls a true horror for sin. Lord ﻿—﻿ say it with a contrite heart ﻿—﻿ may I never offend you again!
But don’t be frightened when you become aware of the burden of your poor body and of human passions: it would be silly and childishly naive to find out now that “this” exists. Your wretchedness is not an obstacle but a spur for you to become more united to God and seek him constantly, because He purifies us.
