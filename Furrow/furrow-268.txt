If you are convinced of your “poor quality” ﻿—﻿ if you know yourself ﻿—﻿ you will react to events supernaturally. Joy and peace will take a firmer root in your soul, in the face of humiliations, being despised, calumnies…
In these cases, after saying fiat ﻿—﻿ Lord, whatever you want ﻿—﻿ you should think: “Is that all he said? He obviously does not know me, otherwise he wouldn’t have left it at that.”
