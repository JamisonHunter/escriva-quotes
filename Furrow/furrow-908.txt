Don’t be worried by those contradictions and all that talk. It is true that we are working in a divine undertaking, but we are men… And it is natural that as we walk we raise dust along the road.
If anything bothers you or hurts you… make use of it for your purification and, if necessary, to straighten out your own behaviour.
