Have you noticed how many of your companions know how to be very kind and considerate when dealing with the people they love, whether it is their girl-friend, their wife, their children or their family?
﻿—﻿Tell them ﻿—﻿ and ask it of yourself too ﻿—﻿ that the Lord does not deserve less. They must treat him that way! Advise them, besides, to continue practising that kindness and consideration, but do it with Him and for Him, and they will achieve, even here on earth, a happiness they had never dreamed of.
