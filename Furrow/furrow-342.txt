342
The salt of the earth. Our Lord said that his disciples ﻿—﻿ you and I also ﻿—﻿ are the salt of the earth: to render immune to infection, to prevent corruption, to season the world.
But he also added: Quod si sal evanuerit… ﻿—﻿ if the salt itself becomes tasteless, it will be cast out and trampled underfoot by men.
