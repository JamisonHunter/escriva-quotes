“You won’t laugh, Father, will you, if I tell you that, a few days ago, I found myself spontaneously offering the Lord the sacrifice of time it meant for me to mend a broken toy for one of my little children?”
﻿—﻿I am not laughing. I am delighted because with that Love, God sets about mending our faults.
