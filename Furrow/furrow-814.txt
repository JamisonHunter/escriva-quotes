Ask Jesus to grant you a Love like a purifying furnace, where your poor flesh ﻿—﻿ your poor heart ﻿—﻿ may be consumed and cleansed of all earthly miseries. Pray that it may be emptied of self and filled with him. Ask him to grant you a deep-seated aversion to all that is worldly so that you may be sustained only by Love.
