Your Communions were very cold: you paid little attention to the Lord: you were distracted by the smallest trifle… But ever since you began to realise during an intimate dialogue with God that the angels are present, your attitude has changed… “Let them not see me like this!”, you say to yourself…
﻿—﻿And see how, as a result of thinking, “What will they say?” ﻿—﻿ this time, for a good motive ﻿—﻿ you have advanced a little towards Love.
