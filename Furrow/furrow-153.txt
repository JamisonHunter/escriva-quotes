153
I will grant that you behave properlyâ€¦ But, allow me to speak sincerely. You must admit that you are doing things in such a leisurely way that, apart from not being entirely happy, you remain very far from holiness.
That is why I ask: Do you really behave properly? Could it be that you have a mistaken idea of what is proper?
