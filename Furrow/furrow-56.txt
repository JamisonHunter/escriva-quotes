Another man of faith wrote to me: “When you have to be on your own, you can notice clearly the help of your brothers. Now, when it comes to my mind that I have to put up with everything ‘all alone’, I often think that, if it weren’t for that ‘company we keep from afar’ ﻿—﻿ the holy Communion of Saints! ﻿—﻿ I would not be able to preserve this optimism which fills my heart.”
