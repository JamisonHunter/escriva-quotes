Listen to me carefully and echo my words: Christianity is Love; getting to know God is a most positive experience; concern for others ﻿—﻿ the apostolate ﻿—﻿ is not an extra luxury, the task of a few.
﻿—﻿Now that you know this, fill yourself with joy, because your life has acquired a completely different meaning; and act in consequence.
