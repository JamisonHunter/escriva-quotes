When you find studying is an awfully uphill task offer that effort to Jesus. Tell him that you continue poring over your books, so that you may use your knowledge as a weapon to fight his enemies and so gain many souls for himâ€¦ You can then be sure that your study is well on its way to becoming prayer.
