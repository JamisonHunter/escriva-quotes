I can see no Christian fraternity in a friend who warns you: “I’ve been told some terrible things about you. You shouldn’t trust someone among those close to you.”
I think it is not Christian because that “brother” has not had the noble reaction of silencing the slanderer first, and then telling you his name out of loyalty.
