Holy Mary is the Queen of peace, and thus the Church invokes her. So when your soul or your family are troubled, or things go wrong at work, in society or between nations, cry out to her without ceasing. Call to her by this title: Regina pacis, ora pro nobis ﻿—﻿ Queen of peace, pray for us. Have you at least tried it when you have lost your calm?… ﻿—﻿You will be surprised at its immediate effect.
