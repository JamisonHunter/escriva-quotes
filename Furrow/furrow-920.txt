This has to be your attitude when faced by defamation. First, forgive everyone from the very beginning and with all your heart. ﻿—﻿Then love. Never fall into a single uncharitable act. Always respond with love!
﻿—﻿But if your Mother the Church is being attacked, defend her courageously. Keep calm, but be firm. Have the strength not to give in, and prevent anyone fouling up or blocking the way ahead for Christian souls when they in their turn are eager to forgive and respond with charity to personal insults.
