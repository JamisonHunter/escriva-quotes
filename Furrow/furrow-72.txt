You are enjoying a few days of great happiness, and your soul is filled with light and colour. And, curiously, the reasons for your joy are the same ones that at other times disheartened you!
It is always the same: it all depends on the point of view. Laetetur cor quaerentium Dominum! ﻿—﻿ when you seek the Lord, your heart always overflows with happiness.
