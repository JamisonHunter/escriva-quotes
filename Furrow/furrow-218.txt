Be honest. If there are people who tell you that you have been trying “to catch them”, admit that this is what you want to do. But there is no need for them to worry! Because, if they haven’t got a vocation ﻿—﻿ if He does not call them ﻿—﻿ they won’t come; and if they have, what a shame for them to end up like the rich young man in the Gospel: alone and sad.
