In this time of God, the time when you are in this world, make up your mind in earnest to do something worthwhile; time is pressing and the mission of men, of women, on earth is so noble, heroic and glorious when it enkindles withered and rotten hearts with the fire of Christ!
﻿—﻿It is worthwhile taking peace and happiness to others through a robust and jubilant crusade.
