You are anxious for one thing: to hurry and soon be forged, moulded, polished and hammered into the piece that fits and will fulfil effectively the work it has been designed to do. This work is the mission it has been assigned to…in the vast field of Christ.
I pray a great deal that this desire of yours may spur you on when you are tired, when you fail and in the hour of darkness… for “the mission it has been assigned to in the vast field of Christ” cannot change.
