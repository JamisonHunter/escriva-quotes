You are writing to me in the kitchen, by the stove. It is early afternoon. It is cold. By your side, your younger sister ﻿—﻿ the last one to discover the divine folly of living her Christian vocation to the full ﻿—﻿ is peeling potatoes. To all appearances ﻿—﻿ you think ﻿—﻿ her work is the same as before. And yet, what a difference there is!
﻿—﻿It is true: before she only peeled potatoes, now, she is sanctifying herself peeling potatoes.
