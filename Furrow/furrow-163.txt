You don’t know whether it is physical depression or a sort of interior tiredness that has come over you, or both at the same time… You fight without fighting, without the desire of an authentic positive improvement, to transmit the joy and love of Christ to souls.
I wish to remind you of the clear words of the Holy Spirit: only those who fight legitime, ﻿—﻿ genuinely, in spite of everything ﻿—﻿ will be crowned.
