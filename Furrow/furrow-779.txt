Soft people who complain about a thousand silly trivialities are the ones who do not know how to sacrifice themselves for Jesus… in those daily trifles ﻿—﻿ let alone sacrifice themselves for others.
What a shame if your behaviour ﻿—﻿ which is so hard and demanding with other people! ﻿—﻿ should show the same softness in your daily life!
