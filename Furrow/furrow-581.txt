I felt pity for that man in office. He suspected that there might have been some problems, which are, after all, to be expected in lifeâ€¦ yet he was taken aback and annoyed when he was told about them. He preferred to remain ignorant of them, to live in the shadow or twilight of his own vision, so that he might remain at ease.
I advised him to face up to these things openly and clearly, so that in this very way they could be got rid of. I assured him that then he would truly live in peace.
