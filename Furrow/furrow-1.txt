There are many Christians who are persuaded that the Redemption will be completed in all environments of the world, and that there have to be some souls ﻿—﻿ they do not know which ones ﻿—﻿ who will contribute to carrying it out with Christ. But they think it will take centuries, many centuries. It would be an eternity, if it were to take place at the rate of their self-giving.
That was the way you yourself thought, until someone came to “wake you up”.
