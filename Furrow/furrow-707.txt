707
A friend of yours, loyally and charitably, points out to you, on your own, certain things which tend to mar your behaviour. You then become convinced that he is mistaken: he doesn’t understand you. If that false conviction, born of your pride, remains, you will never change.
﻿—﻿I pity you: you lack the decision to seek holiness.
