The world awaits us. Yes! We love the world passionately because God has taught us to: Sic Deus dilexit mundum… ﻿—﻿ God so loved the world. And we love it because it is there that we fight our battles in a most beautiful war of charity, so that everyone may find the peace that Christ has come to establish.
