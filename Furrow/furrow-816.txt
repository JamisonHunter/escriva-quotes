816
The Master said: “I have come to set a man at variance with his father, and the daughter with her mother, and the daughter-in-law with her mother-in-law…” If you fulfil what he demands of you, you will show you really love them. That is why you must not use the whole-hearted affection you should have for them as a shield when the moment comes for personal sacrifice. Otherwise, believe me, you will be putting love for your parents before the love of God. And you will be putting your own self-love before love for your parents.
