Sectarians protest loudly against what they call “our fanaticism” because the centuries go by and the Catholic Faith remains immutable.
On the other hand, the fanaticism of the sectarians, since it bears no relation to the truth, changes its coat at different times. They raise against the Holy Church a bogey of mere words lacking in any factual content. Their “freedom” enchains men; their “progress” leads humanity back to the jungle; their “science” conceals ignorance. Behind their stall are hidden only old damaged goods.
