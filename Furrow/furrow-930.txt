930
“Nor do men light a lamp and put it under a bushel, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.”
And at the end of his time upon earth, Christ commanded: Euntes docete ﻿—﻿ go out and teach. He wants his light to shine in the behaviour and words of his disciples, and in yours too.
