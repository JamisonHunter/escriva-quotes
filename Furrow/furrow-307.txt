307
A fundamental error against which you must be on guard is to think that the noble and just customs and needs of your times and environment cannot be directed and accommodated to the holiness of the moral teaching of Jesus Christ.
Notice that I have specified that the customs and needs should be “noble and just”. The other ones lack the right to be adopted by citizens.
