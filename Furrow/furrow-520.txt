Some people act out of prejudice in their work: on principle they trust nobody, and it goes without saying that they do not understand the need to seek to sanctify their job. If you mention it to them they tell you not to add another burden to their own work, which they put up with reluctantly as if they were supporting a heavy weight.
﻿—﻿That is one of the battles of peace we have to win: to find God in our work and, with Him and like Him, serve others.
