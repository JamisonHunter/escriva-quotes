The world is cold and seems to be asleep. ﻿—﻿You often look on it, from your vantage point, with a glance that would set it on fire. Lord, may it awaken!
﻿—﻿Channel your bursts of impatience and be sure that if we manage to keep our whole life alight, we shall set every corner of the world alight, and the way it all looks will change.
