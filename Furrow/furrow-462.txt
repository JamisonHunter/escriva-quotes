I am glad that in your prayer you tend to go far: you contemplate lands different from the one in which you find yourself; before your eyes pass people of other races; you hear different tongues… It is like an echo of that commandment of Jesus, Euntes docete omnes gentes ﻿—﻿ go, teach all nations.
To go ever further, you must enkindle that fire among those around you. Your dreams and ambitions will become reality: sooner, more and better!
