What must the cheerful way that Jesus looked upon people have been like? It must have been the same which shone from the eyes of his Mother who could not contain her joy ﻿—﻿ Magnificat anima mea Dominum! ﻿—﻿ and her soul glorified the Lord while she carried Him within her and by her side.
Oh, Mother!: May we, like you, rejoice to be with Him and to hold Him.
