When the apostles had scattered, and the enraged mob made themselves hoarse shouting angrily at Jesus, the Holy Virgin Mary followed close behind her Son along the streets of Jerusalem. She did not draw back when the crowd cried out, nor did she leave Our Redeemer alone when each person, anonymous in that procession, was in his cowardice emboldened to ill-treat Christ.
Call on her with all your strength: Virgo fidelis!, Virgin most faithful!, and ask her that those of us who call ourselves Godâ€™s friends may truly be so at all times.
