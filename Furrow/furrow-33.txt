The Blessed Virgin Mary, Teacher of unlimited self-giving. Do you remember? It was in praise of her that Jesus Christ said: “Whoever fulfils the Will of my Father, he ﻿—﻿ she ﻿—﻿ is my mother!…”
Ask of this good Mother that her answer, with the generosity it shows, may grow stronger in your soul ﻿—﻿ with the strength of love and liberation. Ecce ancilla Domini ﻿—﻿ behold the handmaid of the Lord.
