What a great discovery! Something you barely half-understood turned out to be very clear when you had to explain it to others.
You had to speak very gently with someone, who was disheartened because he felt useless and did not want to be a burden to anyone… You understood then, better than ever, why I always talk to you about being little donkeys turning the water-wheel: carrying on faithfully, with large blinkers which prevent us personally seeing or tasting the results ﻿—﻿ the flowers, the fruit, the freshness of the garden ﻿—﻿ confident about the effectiveness of our fidelity.
