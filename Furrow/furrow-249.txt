249
Sacrifice, sacrifice! It is true that to follow Jesus Christ is to carry the Cross ﻿—﻿ He has said so. But I don’t like to hear souls who love Our Lord speak so much about crosses and renunciations, because where there is Love, it is a willing sacrifice ﻿—﻿ though it remains hard ﻿—﻿ and the cross is the Holy Cross.
﻿—﻿A soul which knows how to love and give itself in this way, is filled with peace and joy. Therefore, why insist on “sacrifice”, as if you were seeking consolation, if Christ’s Cross ﻿—﻿ which is your life ﻿—﻿ makes you happy?
