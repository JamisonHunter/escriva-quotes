If you really want to be a penitent soul ﻿—﻿ both penitent and cheerful ﻿—﻿ you must above all stick to your daily periods of prayer, which should be intimate, generous and not cut short. And you must make sure that those minutes of prayer are not done only when you feel the need, but at fixed times, whenever it is possible. Don’t neglect these details.
If you subject yourself totally to this daily worship of God, I can assure you that you will always be happy.
