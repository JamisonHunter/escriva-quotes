I must warn you against a ploy of satan ﻿—﻿ yes, without a capital, because he deserves no more ﻿—﻿ who tries to make use of the most ordinary circumstances, to turn us away, slightly or greatly, from the way that leads us to God.
If you are struggling, and even more if you are really struggling, you should not be surprised at feeling tired or at having sometimes to “go against the grain”, without any spiritual or human consolation. See what someone wrote to me some time ago, and which I kept for those who naively consider that grace does away with nature: “Father, for a few days now I have been feeling tremendously lazy and lacking in enthusiasm for fulfilling the plan of life. I have to force myself to do everything, and I have very little taste for it. Pray for me so that this crisis may soon pass, for it makes me suffer a lot to think it could make me turn from my way.”
