Non habemus hic manentem civitatem ﻿—﻿ our definitive home is not to be found on this earth. ﻿—﻿And so that we don’t forget it, at the hour of death this truth appears crudely at times, in lack of understanding, say, or in persecution or in being despised. ﻿—﻿But there is always a sense of loneliness, for even though we may be surrounded by affection, every person dies alone.
﻿—﻿Now is the time to untie all the bonds that bind us! Let us prepare ourselves at all times for that step which will bring us into the eternal presence of the Most Holy Trinity.
