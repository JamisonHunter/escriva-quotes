If, to free you, a close friend of yours had gone to prison, would you not try to visit him, to talk to him for a while, take him some present, console him and show him the warmth of your friendship…? And, if that conversation with the prisoner were to save you from some evil and do you good… would you go without it? And if instead of a friend it were to be your father himself or your brother?
﻿—﻿Well then!
