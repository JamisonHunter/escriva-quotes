Allow your soul to be consumed by desires ﻿—﻿ desires for loving, for being forgotten, for holiness, for Heaven. Do not stop to wonder whether the time will come to see them accomplished, as some pseudo-adviser might suggest. Make them more fervent every day, for the Holy Spirit says that he is pleased with men of desires.
Let your desires be operative and put them into practice in your daily tasks.
