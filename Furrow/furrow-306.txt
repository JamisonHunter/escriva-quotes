Through your behaviour as a Christian citizen, show people the difference between living sadly and living cheerfully; between being timid and being daring; between acting cautiously, with duplicity ﻿—﻿ hypocritically ﻿—﻿ and acting as men of simplicity and integrity. In a word, between being worldly and being children of God.
