You wrote to tell me that you have at last gone to confession and that you experienced the humiliation of having to open the sewer ﻿—﻿ that is what you say ﻿—﻿ of your life to “a man”.
When will you get rid of that feeling of vain self-esteem? You will then go to confession extremely happy to show yourself as you are to “that man”, who, being anointed, is a Christ ﻿—﻿ Christ himself ﻿—﻿ and gives you absolution, God’s forgiveness.
