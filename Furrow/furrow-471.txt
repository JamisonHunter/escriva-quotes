I understand perfectly when you write to me about your apostolate: “I am going to pray for three hours, studying Physics. It will be a bombardment so that another position, which is on the other side of the library table, falls ﻿—﻿ you have met him already when he came round here.”
I remember how happy you were when you heard me say that prayer and work can easily go together.
