An impatient and disordered anxiousness to climb up the professional ladder can mask self-love under the appearances of “serving souls”. It is a lie ﻿—﻿ and I really mean that ﻿—﻿ when we seek to justify our actions by saying that we must not miss certain opportunities, certain favourable chances.
Turn your eyes back to Jesus; he is “the Way”. During his hidden years, there were also “very favourable” chances to advance his public life ﻿—﻿ when he was twelve years old, for instance, and the doctors of the law were in amazement at his questions and at the answers he gave. But Jesus Christ fulfils the Will of his Father, and he waits. He obeys!
