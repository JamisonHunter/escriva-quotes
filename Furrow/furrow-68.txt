It is all too easy to say: “I’m useless; nothing turns out right for me ﻿—﻿ for us.”
﻿—﻿Apart from not being true, that pessimism masks a great deal of laziness. There are things you do well, and things you do badly. Fill yourself with joy and with hope on account of the former; and face up to the latter ﻿—﻿ without losing heart ﻿—﻿ to put things right; and they will work out.
