Everything may collapse and fail. Events may turn out contrary to what was expected and great adversity may come. But nothing is to be gained by being perturbed. Furthermore, remember the confident prayer of the prophet: “The Lord is our judge, the Lord gives us our laws, the Lord is our king; it is he who will save us.”
﻿—﻿Say it devoutly every day, so that your behaviour may agree with the designs of Providence, which governs us for our own good.
