Naturalness has nothing to do with coarseness, or being shabby or doing things poorly, or being bad-mannered.
Some people are determined to reduce the service of God to working in the world of miserable and ﻿—﻿ forgive the expression ﻿—﻿ lousy poverty. Such work is and will always be admirable; but if we stop there, apart from abandoning the vast majority of souls, what should we do when we have brought them out of their need ﻿—﻿ ignore them?
