234
You asked Our Lord to let you suffer a little for Him. But when suffering comes in such a normal, human form ﻿—﻿ family difficulties and problems… or those thousand awkward things of ordinary life ﻿—﻿ you find it hard to see Christ behind it. ﻿—﻿Open your hands willingly to those nails… and your sorrow will be turned into joy.
