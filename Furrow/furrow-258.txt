Cor Mariae perdolentis, miserere nobis! ﻿—﻿ Invoke the Heart of Holy Mary, with the purpose and determination of uniting yourself to her sorrow, in reparation for your sins and the sins of men of all times.
And pray to her ﻿—﻿ for every soul ﻿—﻿ that her sorrow may increase in us our aversion to sin, and that we may be able to love the physical or moral contradictions of each day as a means of expiation.
