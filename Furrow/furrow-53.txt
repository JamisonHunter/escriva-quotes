Servite Domino in laetitia! ﻿—﻿ I will serve God cheerfully. With a cheerfulness that is a consequence of my Faith, of my Hope and of my Love ﻿—﻿ and that will last for ever. For, as the Apostle assures us, Dominus prope est!… ﻿—﻿ the Lord follows me closely. I shall walk with Him, therefore, quite confidently, for the Lord is my Father, and with his help I shall fulfil his most lovable Will, even if I find it hard.
