As the reverse side of a “lost” vocation, or of a negative response to one of those constant calls of grace, we have to see God’s will allowing it to happen. ﻿—﻿True, but if we are sincere, we know well enough that this does not mean the excuse or mitigation of whatever happened. Because, looking at the obverse side, we can see a personal failure to fulfil the divine Will, which has sought us for himself and found no response.
