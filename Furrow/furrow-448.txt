You haven’t been praying? Why, because you haven’t had time?
﻿—﻿But you do have time. Furthermore, what sort of works will you be able to do if you have not meditated on them in the presence of the Lord, so as to put them in order? Without that conversation with God, how can you finish your daily work with perfection? ﻿—﻿Look, it is as if you claimed you had no time to study because you were too busy giving lessons… Without study you cannot teach well.
