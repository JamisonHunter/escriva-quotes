Never adopt a superior air towards Church matters, or towards your fellow human beings, your brothersâ€¦ On the other hand that attitude might be necessary in your social behaviour, when it is a matter of defending the interests of God and those of souls, for then you would not be acting out of superiority, but out of faith and fortitude, which we will practise with a calm and humble confidence.
