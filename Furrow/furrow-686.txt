Jesus has remained in the Sacred Host for us! So as to stay by our side, to sustain us, to guide us. ﻿—﻿And love can only be repaid with love.
﻿—﻿How could we not turn to the Blessed Sacrament each day, even if it is only for a few minutes, to bring him our greetings and our love as children and as brothers?
