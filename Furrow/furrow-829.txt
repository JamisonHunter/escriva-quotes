The thought of what has happened to you burns within you. Christ came to you when you were only a miserable leper! Until then, you had developed only one good quality, a generous concern for others. After that encounter you were given the grace to see Jesus in them, you fell in love with him, and now you love him in themâ€¦ Now the altruism that used to impel you to help your neighbour in certain ways seems very small. You are right to think so!
