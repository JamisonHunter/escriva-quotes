251
Do not pass by a neighbour’s affliction with indifference. That person ﻿—﻿ a relative, a friend, a colleague… someone you don’t know ﻿—﻿ is your brother.
﻿—﻿Remember the Gospel story you have heard so often with sadness: not even the relatives of Jesus trusted Him. ﻿—﻿Make sure the scene is not repeated.
