206
I understand your holy impatience, but at the same time you must realise that there are some who need to think things over for a long time and others who will respond all in good timeâ€¦ Wait for them with open arms. Add the spice of abundant prayer and mortification to your holy impatience. They will be more youthful and generous when they come. They will have got rid of their bourgeois approach, and they will be all the more courageous.
Think how God is waiting for them!
