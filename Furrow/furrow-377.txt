377
The Lord wants a definite apostolate from you, such as catching those one hundred and fifty-three big fish ﻿—﻿ not others ﻿—﻿ taken on the right-hand side of the boat.
And you ask me: How is it I know myself to be a fisher of men, can live in contact with many companions, and be able to distinguish to whom I should direct my specific apostolate, but still catch nobody? Is it Love that is lacking? Do I lack interior life?
