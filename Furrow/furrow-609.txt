When you work in apostolic enterprises, do not build for the present alone… Dedicate yourself to these tasks with the hope that others ﻿—﻿ brothers of yours sharing the same spirit as you ﻿—﻿ may reap what you are now sowing abroad, and may crown the buildings for which you are now laying the foundations.
