How clearly I see now that “holy shamelessness” is rooted, very deeply, in the Gospel! Fulfil the Will of God…, remembering Jesus falsely accused, Jesus spat upon and buffeted, Jesus brought before the shabby courts of men… And Jesus silent!!
﻿—﻿A resolution: I shall bow my head when insulted, and ﻿—﻿ knowing that humiliations will certainly follow ﻿—﻿ I shall persevere in the divine undertaking with which the merciful Love of Our Lord has wished to entrust us.
