507
You tried to belittle somebody else’s work by mumbling: “He has only done his duty.”
And I said, “Does that seem so little to you?” The Lord gives us the happiness of Heaven for doing our duty: Euge serve bone et fidelis… intra in gaudium Domini tui ﻿—﻿ Well done good and faithful servant, enter into eternal joy!
