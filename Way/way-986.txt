'The truth is that there is no need to be a hero', you confess, 'to know how to isolate oneself as far as circumstances demand ﻿—﻿ without going to ridiculous extremes ﻿—﻿ and to persevere.' And you add: 'So long as I carry out the norms you gave me, the snares and pitfalls of my surroundings don't worry me: to fear such trifles ﻿—﻿ that is what I would be afraid of.'
Wonderful!
