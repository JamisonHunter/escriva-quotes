Everything in which we poor men have a part ﻿—﻿ even holiness ﻿—﻿ is a fabric of small trifles which, depending upon one's intention, can form a magnificent tapestry of heroism or of degradation, of virtues or of sins.
The epic legends always relate extraordinary adventures, but never fail to mix them with homely details about the hero. ﻿—﻿ May you always attach great importance to the little things. This is the way!
