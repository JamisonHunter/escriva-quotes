If you feel the Communion of Saints ﻿—﻿ if you live it ﻿—﻿ you will gladly be a man of penance. And you will realize that penance is gaudium, etsi laboriosum, joy, in spite of its hardship. And you will feel yourself 'allied' to all the penitent souls that have been, that are, and that ever will be.
