110
You have told me sometimes that you are like a clock out of order, which strikes at the wrong moment: you feel cold, dry and arid at the time of your prayer, and on the other hand, when it is least to be expected, in the street, in the midst of your daily activities, in the bustle and hubbub of the city, or in the concentrated calm of your professional work, you find yourself prayingâ€¦ At the wrong moment? Possibly; but don't waste those chimes of your clock. The Spirit breathes where he will.
