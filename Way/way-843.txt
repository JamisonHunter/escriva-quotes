'Non manifeste, sed quasi in occulto, quite privately, without drawing attention to himself': So Jesus goes up to the feast of Tabernacles. So will he go, on the way to Emmaus, with Cleophas and his companion. So is he seen, after his Resurrection, by Mary Magdalen.
And so will he appear ﻿—﻿ 'the disciples did not realise that it was Jesus' ﻿—﻿ at the miraculous catch of fishes, as Saint John tells us.
