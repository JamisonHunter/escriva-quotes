It's not enough to be learned, in addition to being a good Christian. If you don't correct the brusqueness of your character, if you make your zeal and your knowledge incompatible with good manners, I can't see you ever becoming a saint. And despite your learning ﻿—﻿ because of it ﻿—﻿ you should be tied in a stall, like a mule.
