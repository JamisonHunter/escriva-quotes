How pitiful are those crowds ﻿—﻿ high and low and middle class ﻿—﻿ who live without ideals! They give the impression that they do not know they have souls: they are a drove, a flock, a herd.
Jesus, with the help of your merciful Love, we will turn the drove into a levy, the flock into an army, and from the herd we will draw, purified, those who no longer wish to be unclean.
