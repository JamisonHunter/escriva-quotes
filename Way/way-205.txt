We were reading ﻿—﻿ you and I ﻿—﻿ the heroically ordinary life of that man of God. ﻿—﻿And we saw him struggle, for months and years (what 'accounts' he kept in his particular examination!), at breakfast time: today he won, tomorrow he was beaten… He noted: 'Didn't take butter…; did take butter!'
May we too ﻿—﻿ you and I ﻿—﻿ live our... 'butter tragedy'.
