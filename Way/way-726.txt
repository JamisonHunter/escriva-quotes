After losing those human consolations you have been left with a feeling of loneliness, as if you were suspended by a mere thread over the black emptiness of the abyss. And your cries, your shouts for help seem to be heard by nobody.
You really deserve to be forlorn. Be humble, don't seek yourself don't seek consolation. Love the Cross ﻿—﻿ to bear it is little ﻿—﻿ and our Lord will hear your prayer. And calm will be restored to your senses. And your wounded heart will heal. And you will have peace.
