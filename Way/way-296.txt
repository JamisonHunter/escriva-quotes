It is hard to read that question of Pilate's in the holy Gospel: 'Whom do you wish me to release to you, Barabbas, or Jesus, who is called Christ?' ﻿—﻿ It is more painful to hear the answer: 'Barabbas!'
And more terrible still when I realize that very often by going astray I too have said 'Barabbas!' and added 'Christ?… Crucify him!'
