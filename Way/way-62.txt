A Director. You need one. So that you can give yourself to God, and give yourself fullyâ€¦, by obedience. A Director who understands your apostolate, who knows what God wants, who can effectively second the work of the holy Spirit in your soul, without taking you from your place, filling you with peace, and teaching you how to make your work fruitful.
