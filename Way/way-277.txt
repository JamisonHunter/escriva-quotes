You ask me: why that wooden Cross? ﻿—﻿ And I copy from a letter: 'As I look up from the microscope, my sight comes to rest on the cross ﻿—﻿ black and empty. That Cross without its Crucified is a symbol. It has a meaning which others cannot see. And though I am tired out and on the point of abandoning the job, I once again bring my eyes to the lens and continue: for the lonely Cross is calling for a pair of shoulders to bear it.'
