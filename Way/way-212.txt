212
That Christ you see is not Jesus. It is only the pitiful image that your blurred eyes are able to form… ﻿—﻿ Purify yourself. Clarify your sight with humility and penance. Then… the pure light of Love will not be denied you. And you will have perfect vision. The image you see will be really his: his!
