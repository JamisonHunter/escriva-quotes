Apostolic soul: first of all, yourself. Our Lord has said, through Saint Matthew: 'When the day of Judgment comes, many will say to me: "Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, work many miracles in your name?" Then I shall tell them to their faces: "I have never known you; away from me, you evil men"'.
God forbid ﻿—﻿ says Saint Paul ﻿—﻿ that I, who have preached to others should myself be rejected.
