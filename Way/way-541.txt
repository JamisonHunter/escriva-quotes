Piety has its own good manners. Learn them. It's a shame to see those 'pious' people who don't know how to attend Mass ﻿—﻿ even though they go daily, ﻿—﻿ nor how to bless themselves (they throw their hands about in the weirdest fashion), nor how to bend the knee before the Tabernacle (their ridiculous genuflections seem a mockery), nor how to bow their heads reverently before a picture of our Lady.
