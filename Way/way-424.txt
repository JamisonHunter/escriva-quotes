To punish out of Love: this is the secret that raises to a supernatural plane the punishment of those who deserve it.
For the love of God, who has been offended, let punishment serve as reparation. For the love of our neighbour and for the sake of God, let it be imposed, never as revenge, but as health-giving medicine.
