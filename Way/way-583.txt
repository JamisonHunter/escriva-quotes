I'm not one for miracles. I have told you that in the holy Gospel I can find more than enough to confirm my faith. ﻿—﻿ But I can't help pitying those Christians ﻿—﻿ pious people, 'apostles' many of them ﻿—﻿ who smile at the idea of extraordinary ways, of supernatural events. I feel the urge to tell them: Yes, this is still the age of miracles: we too would work them if we had faith!
