326
It hurts me to see the danger of lukewarmness in which you place yourself when you do not strive seriously for perfection in your state in life.
Say with me: I don't want to be lukewarm! Confige timore tuo carnes meas, pierce thou my flesh with thy fear: grant me, my God, a filial fear that will make me react!
