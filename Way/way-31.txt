31
Selfish. Always looking after yourself You seem incapable of feeling the fraternity of Christ. In those around you, you do not see brothers: you see stepping stones.
I can foresee your complete failure. And when you have fallen, you will want others to treat you with the charity you are not willing to show towards them.
