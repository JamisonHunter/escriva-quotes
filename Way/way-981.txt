'Now after this' ﻿—﻿ we read in the eighth chapter of Saint Luke ﻿—﻿ 'he made his way through towns and villages preaching, and proclaiming the Good News of the kingdom of God. With him went the Twelve, as well as certain women who had been cured of evil spirits and ailments: Mary surnamed the Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out, Joanna the wife of Herod's steward Chusa, Susanna, and several others who provided for them out of their own resources'.
I copy. And I pray God that if some woman reads this, she may be filled with a holy and fruitful envy.
