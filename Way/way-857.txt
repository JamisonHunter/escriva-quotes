Be a little child; the greatest daring is always that of children Who cries forâ€¦ the moon? Who is blind to dangers in getting what he wants?
To such a child add much grace from God, the desire to do his Will, great love for Jesus, all the human knowledge he is capable of acquiring, and you will have a likeness of the apostles of today such as God undoubtedly wants them.
