'Domine! ﻿—﻿ Lord ﻿—﻿ si vis, potes me mundare, ﻿—﻿ if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.'
What a beautiful prayer for you to say often, with the faith of the poor leper, when there happens to you what God and you and I know! You will not have to wait long to hear the Master's reply: 'Volo, mundare! I will: be thou made clean!'
