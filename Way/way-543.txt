You saw me celebrate the holy Mass on a plain altar﻿—﻿ table and stone, without a reredos. Both Crucifix and candlesticks were large and solid, with wax-candles of graded height, sloping up towards the Cross. The frontal, of the liturgical colour of the day. A sweeping chasuble. The chalice, rich, simple in line, with a broad cup. No electric light, nor did we miss it.
And you found it difficult to leave the oratory: you felt at home there. ﻿—﻿ Do you see how we are led to God, brought closer to him, by the rigour of the liturgy?
