You've done well…, even though you have fallen so low. You have done well, because you humbled yourself, because you put things right, because you filled yourself with hope, and that hope brought you back again to his Love. Don't look so amazed: you have done well! You rose up from the ground: 'Surge ﻿—﻿ arise,' the mighty voice cried anew, 'et ambula! ﻿—﻿ and walk!' Now ﻿—﻿ to work!
