How clear the way! How easily seen the obstacles! What good weapons to overcome them!… ﻿—﻿ And nevertheless, what side-tracking and what stumbling! Isn't it true?
That fine thread ﻿—﻿ that chain: that chain of wrought iron ﻿—﻿ of which you and I are conscious and which you don't want to break, that is what draws you from your way and makes you stumble and even fall.
