Paradoxes of a little soul. When Jesus sends you what people call 'good luck', feel sorrow in your heart at the thought of his goodness and your wickedness. When Jesus sends you what people call 'bad luck', be glad in your heart, for he always gives you what is best and then is the beautiful moment to love the Cross.
