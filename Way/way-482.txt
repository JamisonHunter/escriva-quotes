What does it matter if you have the whole world against you, with all its power? You… keep going!
Repeat the words of the psalm: 'The Lord is my light and my salvation: whom need I fear? Si consistant adversum me castra, non timebit cor meum. ﻿—﻿ Though an army pitched camp against me, my heart shall not be afraid'.
