You never want to get to the heart of the matter. Sometimes, through politeness. Other times, most times, through fear of hurting yourself Sometimes again, through fear of hurting others. And, always, through fear!
As long as you are so afraid of the truth you will never be a man of sound judgment, a man of worth.
