How is that heart of yours getting along? Don't worry: the saints ﻿—﻿ who were perfectly ordinary, normal beings like you and me ﻿—﻿ also felt those 'natural' inclinations. And if they had not felt them, their 'supernatural' reaction of keeping their heart ﻿—﻿ soul and body ﻿—﻿ for God, instead of giving it to creatures, would have had little merit.
That's why, once the way is seen, I think that the heart's weaknesses need be no obstacle for a determined soul, for a soul in love.
