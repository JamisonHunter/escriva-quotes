269
Don't be so blind or so thoughtless as not to enter inside each Tabernacle when you glimpse the walls or spires of the houses of God. He is waiting for you.
Don't be so blind or so thoughtless as not to invoke Mary Immaculate with an ejaculation at least, whenever you pass near those places where you know that Christ is offended.
