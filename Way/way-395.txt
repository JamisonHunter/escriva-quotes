Listen to a man of God, an old campaigner, as he argues: 'So I won't yield an inch? And why should I, if I am convinced of the truth of my ideals? You, on the other hand, are very ready to compromiseâ€¦ Would you agree that two and two are three and a half? You wouldn't? Surely for friendship's sake you will yield in such a little thing?'
And why won't you? Simply because, for the first time, you feel convinced that you possess the truth, and you have come over to my way of thinking!
