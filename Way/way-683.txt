I see you, christian gentleman ﻿—﻿ that is what you say you are ﻿—﻿ kissing an image, mumbling a vocal prayer, crying out against those who attack the Church of God…, and even frequenting the holy Sacraments.
But I don't see you making any sacrifice, or avoiding certain conversations of a 'worldly' nature (I could with justice use another term), or being generous towards those in need or towards that Church of Christ, or putting up with a failing in one of your brothers, or checking your pride for the sake of the common good, or getting rid of your tight cloak of selfishness, or… so many things more!
