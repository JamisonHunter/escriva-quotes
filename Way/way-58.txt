58
Don't hinder the work of the Paraclete: seek union with Christ so as to be purified, and feel with him the insults, the spits, and the blows, and the thorns, and the weight of the Crossâ€¦, and the nails tearing through your flesh, and the agony of a forsaken death.
And enter through our Lord's open side until you find sure refuge there in his wounded Heart.
