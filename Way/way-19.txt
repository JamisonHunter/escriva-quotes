Will-power. A very important quality. Don't despise little things, for by the continual practice of denying yourself again and again in such things ﻿—﻿ which are never futile or trivial ﻿—﻿ with God's grace you will add strength and resilience to your character. In that way you will first become master of yourself, and then a guide, a chief, a leader: to compel and to urge and to inspire others, with your word, with your example, with your knowledge and with your power.
