255
You want to hear all that I think of 'your way'? Very well, then…, listen: if you respond to the call, you will do your utmost in your work for Christ: if you become a man of prayer, you will be granted the grace necessary to respond and, hungry for sacrifice, you will seek out the hardest tasks…
And you will be happy here, and unspeakably happy hereafter.
