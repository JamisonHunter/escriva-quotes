To be 'Catholic' means to love your country and to be second to no one in that love. And at the same time, to hold as your own the noble aspirations of other lands. ﻿—﻿ So many glories of France are glories of mine! And in the same way, much that makes Germans proud, and the peoples of Italy and of England…, and Americans and Asians and Africans, is a source of pride to me also.
Catholic: big heart, broad mind.
