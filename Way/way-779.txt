It is good to give glory to God, without seeking foretastes (wife children, honoursâ€¦) of that glory, which we will enjoy fully with him in the next Life.
Besides, he is generous. He returns a hundredfold; and he does so even in children. Many give them up for the sake of his glory, and they have thousands of children of their spirit. Children, as we are children of our Father who is in heaven.
