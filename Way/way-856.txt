Spiritual childhood demands submission of the mind, more difficult than submission of the will. In order to subject our mind we need not only God's grace, but also the continual exercise of our will, which says 'no' again and again, just as it says 'no' to the flesh. And so we get the paradox that whoever wants to follow this 'little' way in order to become a child, needs to add strength and virility to his will.
