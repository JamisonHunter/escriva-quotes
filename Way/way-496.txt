How people like to be reminded of their relationship with distinguished figures in literature, in politics, in the army, in the Church!… Sing to the Immaculate Virgin, reminding her: Hail Mary, daughter of God the Father: Hail Mary, Mother of God the Son: Hail Mary, Spouse of God the holy Spirit…
Greater than you, none but God!
