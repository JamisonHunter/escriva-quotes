We all have to be ipse Christus ﻿—﻿ Christ himself. This is what Saint Paul commands in the name of God: Induimini Dominum Iesum Christum ﻿—﻿ put on the Lord Jesus Christ.
Each one of us ﻿—﻿ you! ﻿—﻿ has to see how he puts on that clothing of which the Apostle speaks. Each one personally, has to sustain an uninterrupted dialogue with the Lord.
