Your prayer went like this: “My wretchedness weighs me down, but it doesn’t overwhelm me because I am a son of God. I want to atone, to Love… And,” you added, “like Saint Paul, I want to turn my weaknesses to good use, convinced that the Lord will not abandon those who place their trust in him.”
﻿—﻿Carry on like that. I assure you that ﻿—﻿ with God’s grace ﻿—﻿ you will succeed, and you will overcome your wretchedness and your shortcomings.
