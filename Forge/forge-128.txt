Love and seek help from the person who guides your soul. In spiritual direction lay your heart completely open ﻿—﻿ rotten, if it were rotten! ﻿—﻿ with all sincerity, with the desire to be cured. If you don’t, you will never get rid of that rottenness.
If you go to someone who can only cleanse the wound superficially… you are a coward, because really you will be going along to hide the truth, doing yourself harm.
