At times, someone has told me: “Father, I feel tired and cold; when I pray or fulfil some other norm of piety, I seem to be acting out a farce…”
To that friend, and to you, if you are in the same boat, I answer: A farce? ﻿—﻿What an excellent thing, my child! Act out that farce! The Lord is your audience ﻿—﻿ the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The Blessed Trinity is contemplating us in those moments when we are “acting out a farce”.
