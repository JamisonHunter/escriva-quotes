Love and practise charity without setting any limits or discriminating between people, for it is the virtue which marks us out as disciples of the Master.
Nevertheless, this charity cannot lead you to dampen your faith ﻿—﻿ for it would then cease to be a virtue. Nor should it blur the clear outlines that define the faith, nor soften it to the point of changing it, as some people try to do, into something amorphous and lacking the strength and power of God.
