Practise a cheerful charity which is at once kindly and firm; human and supernatural. An affectionate charity, knowing how to welcome everyone with a sincere and habitual smile, and how to understand the ideas and the feelings of others.
﻿—﻿In this way, gently and vigorously, and without concessions in matters of personal morals or in doctrine, the charity of Christ ﻿—﻿ when it is being well lived ﻿—﻿ will give you a spirit of conquest. Each day you will be more eager to work for souls.
