Jesus Our Lord loved men so much that he became incarnate, took to himself our nature, and lived in daily contact with the poor and the rich, with the just and with sinners, with young and old, with Gentiles and Jews.
He spoke constantly to everyone: to those who showed good will towards him, and to those who were only looking for a way to twist his words and condemn him.
