10
Think about what the Holy Spirit says, and let yourself be filled with awe and gratitude: Elegit nos ante mundi constitutionem ﻿—﻿ he chose us before the foundation of the world, ut essemus sancti in conspectu eius! ﻿—﻿ that we might be holy in his presence.
﻿—﻿To be holy isn’t easy, but it isn’t difficult either. To be holy is to be a good Christian, to resemble Christ. The more closely a person resembles Christ, the more Christian he is, the more he belongs to Christ, the holier he is.
