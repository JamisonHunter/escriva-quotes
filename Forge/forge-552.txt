There are many good reasons to honour Saint Joseph, and to learn from his life. He was a man of strong faith. He earned a living for his family ﻿—﻿ Jesus and Mary ﻿—﻿ with his own hard work… He guarded the purity of the Blessed Virgin, who was his Spouse. And he respected ﻿—﻿ he loved! ﻿—﻿ God’s freedom, when God made his choice: not only his choice of Our Lady the Virgin as his Mother, but also his choice of Saint Joseph as the Husband of Holy Mary.
