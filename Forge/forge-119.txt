Don’t be ashamed to discover in your heart the fomes peccati ﻿—﻿ the inclination to evil, which will be with you as long as you live, for nobody is free from this burden.
Don’t be ashamed, because the all-powerful and merciful Lord has given us all the means we need for overcoming this inclination: the Sacraments, a life of piety and sanctified work.
