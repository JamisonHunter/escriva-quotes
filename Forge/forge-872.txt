Per Iesum Christum Dominum nostrum: through Jesus Christ, Our Lord. That is the way you should do things: through and for Jesus Christ!
﻿—﻿It’s good that you have a human heart. But if you act merely because it’s a particular person, that’s bad. You should certainly also do it for that brother of yours, for that friend of yours: but above all do it for Jesus Christ!
