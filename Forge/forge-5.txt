5
Lord, we are glad to find ourselves in your wounded palm. Grasp us tight, squeeze us hard, make us lose all our earthly wretchedness, purify us, set us on fire, make us feel drenched in your Blood.
﻿—﻿And then, cast us far, far away, hungry for the harvest, to sow the seed more fruitfully each day, for Love of you.
