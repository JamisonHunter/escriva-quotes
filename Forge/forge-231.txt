231
A sick man is brought to Jesus, who looks at him. ﻿—﻿ Contemplate the scene closely and meditate on his words: confide, fili ﻿—﻿ take heart, my son.
This is what Our Lord says to you when you feel the weight of your errors. Have faith! In the first place: faith. And then allow yourself to be carried like the paralytic did: with interior and submissive obedience!
