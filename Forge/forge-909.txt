You say that you want to be an apostle of Christ.
﻿—﻿I’m very glad to hear it. I pray that God may give you perseverance. Remember that from our mouths, from our thoughts, from our hearts, should issue only divine motives, of hunger for souls, of themes that lead us one way or another to God ﻿—﻿ or at least, that do not take us away from him.
