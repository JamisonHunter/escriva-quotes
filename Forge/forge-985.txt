985
The day you no longer strive to draw others closer to God ﻿—﻿ since you ought to be a burning coal all the time ﻿—﻿ you will become a contemptible little piece of charcoal, or a little heap of ashes to be scattered by the slightest puff of wind.
﻿—﻿You have to be on fire; you need to be a thing that burns, producing flames of the love of God, of faithfulness and apostolate.
