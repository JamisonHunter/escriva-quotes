Sweet Mother…, lead us to that madness that will make others fall madly in love with our Christ.
Sweet Lady Mary, may Love not be in us a flash in the pan, or a will-o’-the-wisp, such as decomposing corpses sometimes produce. May it be a true devouring fire, which sets alight and burns everything it touches.
