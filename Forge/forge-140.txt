Live your Christian life with naturalness! Let me stress this: make Christ known through your behaviour, just as an ordinary mirror reproduces an image without distorting it or turning it into a caricature. ﻿—﻿ If, like the mirror, you are normal, you will reflect Christ’s life, and show it to others.
