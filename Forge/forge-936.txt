Please donâ€™t let yourself become bourgeois, for if you do, you will be a hindrance. You will become a dead weight for others in the apostolate and, above all, a source of suffering for the Heart of Christ.
You must not stop doing apostolate, nor abandon your effort to do your work as best you can, nor neglect your life of piety.
