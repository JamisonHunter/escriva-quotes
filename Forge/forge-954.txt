You have to love your fellow men to the point where even their defects, as long as they do not constitute an offence against God, hardly seem to you to be defects at all. If you love only the good qualities you see in others ﻿—﻿ if you do not know how to be understanding, to make allowances for them and forgive them ﻿—﻿ you are an egoist.
