Lord, from now on let me become someone else: no longer “me”, but that “other person” you would like me to be.
﻿—﻿Let me not deny you anything you ask of me. Let me know how to pray. Let me know how to suffer. Let me not worry about anything except your glory. Let me feel your presence all the time.
