116
Fill yourself with good desires, which is a holy thing, praised by God. But don’t leave it at that! You have to be a soul ﻿—﻿ a man, a woman ﻿—﻿ who deals in realities. To carry out those good desires, you have to formulate clear and precise resolutions.
﻿—﻿And then, my child, you have to fight to put them into practice, with God’s grace.
