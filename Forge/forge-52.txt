You wrote: “My King, I hear you proclaiming in a loud voice that still resounds: Ignem veni mittere in terram, et quid volo nisi ut accendatur? ﻿—﻿ I have come to cast fire upon the earth, and would that it were already kindled!”
Then you added: “Lord, it is me ﻿—﻿ all of me ﻿—﻿ who answers with all my senses and faculties: Ecce ego quia vocasti me! ﻿—﻿ here I am because you have called me.”
