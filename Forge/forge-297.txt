The system, the method, the procedure, the only way to have a life abundant and fertile in supernatural fruits, is to follow the Holy Spirit’s advice, which comes to us via the Acts of the Apostles: omnes erant perseverantes unanimiter in oratione ﻿—﻿ all these with one accord devoted themselves to prayer.
﻿—﻿Nothing can be done without prayer!
