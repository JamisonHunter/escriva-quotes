Invoke the Blessed Virgin. Keep asking her to show herself a Mother to you ﻿—﻿ monstra te esse Matrem! As well as drawing down her Son’s grace, may she bring the clarity of sound doctrine to your mind, and love and purity to your heart, so that you may know the way to God and take many souls to him.
