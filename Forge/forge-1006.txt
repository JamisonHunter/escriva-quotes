1006
With crystal clarity I see the formula, the secret of happiness, both earthly and eternal. It is not just a matter of accepting the Will of God but of embracing it, of identifying oneself with it ﻿—﻿ in a word, of loving the Divine Will with a positive act of our own will.
﻿—﻿This, I repeat, is the infallible secret of joy and peace.
