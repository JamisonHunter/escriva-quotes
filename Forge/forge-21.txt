The commandment to love our parents belongs to both natural law and to divine positive law, and I have always called it a “most sweet precept”.
﻿—﻿Do not neglect your obligation to love your parents more each day, to mortify yourself for them, to pray for them and to be grateful to them for all the good you owe them.
