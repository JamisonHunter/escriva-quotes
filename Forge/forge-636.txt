We have to try to ensure that in all fields of intellectual activity there are upright people, people with a true Christian conscience, who are consistent in their lives, who can use the weapons of knowledge in the service of humanity and of the Church.
Because in the world there will always be, as there were when Jesus came on earth, new Herods who try to make use of scientific knowledge ﻿—﻿ even if they have to falsify it ﻿—﻿ to persecute Christ and those who belong to him.
