When we think we have been accused of something unjustly, we should examine our behaviour, in God’s presence, cum gaudio et pace ﻿—﻿ calmly and cheerfully; and we should change our ways if charity bids us, even if our actions were harmless.
﻿—﻿We have to struggle to be saints, more and more each day. Then let people say what they like so long as we can apply the words of the beatitude to their utterances: Beati estis cum… dixerint omne malum adversus vos mentientes propter me ﻿—﻿ Blessed are you when they slander you for my sake.
