To have a Catholic spirit means that we should feel on our shoulders the weight of our concern for the entire Church ﻿—﻿ not just of this or that particular part of it. It means that our prayer should spread out north and south, east and west, in a generous act of petition.
So you will understand the cry ﻿—﻿ the aspiration ﻿—﻿ of that friend of ours, faced by the little love of so many people towards our Holy Mother: “I suffer for my Church!”
