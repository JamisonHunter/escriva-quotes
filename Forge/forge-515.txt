Repeat to yourself, with all your heart, and with ever-increasing love, and more when you are in front of the Tabernacle or have the Lord within your breast: Non est qui se abscondat a calore eius ﻿—﻿ “No one can hide from his warmth.” May I not flee from you, may I be filled with the fire of your Holy Spirit.
