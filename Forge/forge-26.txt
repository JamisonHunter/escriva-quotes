It is painful to see that after two thousand years there are so few people in the world who call themselves Christians and that of those who do call themselves Christians, so few practise the true teaching of Jesus Christ.
It is worth while putting our whole life at stake!: working and suffering for Love, to accomplish Godâ€™s plans and co-redeem.
