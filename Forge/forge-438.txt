Love Our Lord very much. Maintain and foster in your soul a sense of urgency to love him better. Love God precisely now when perhaps a good many of those who hold him in their hands do not love him, but rather ill-treat and neglect him.
Be sure to take good care of the Lord for me, in the Holy Mass and throughout the whole day!
