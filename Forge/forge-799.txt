799
In silentio et in spe erit fortitudo vestra ﻿—﻿ in quietness and in trust shall be your strength… This is what the Lord assures to those who are his own. Keep quiet, and trust in him. These are two essential weapons in moments of difficulty, when there doesn’t seem to be any human solution.
Look at Jesus in his Holy Passion and Death: suffering borne without complaint is also a measure of love.
