429
Holiness is attained with the help of the Holy Spirit, who comes to dwell in our souls, through grace given us by the sacraments and as a result of a constant ascetical struggle.
My son, let us not have any false illusions about this. You and I ﻿—﻿ I will never tire of repeating it ﻿—﻿ will always have to struggle, always, until the end of our lives. So we will come to love peace, and we will spread peace around us, and we will receive our everlasting reward.
