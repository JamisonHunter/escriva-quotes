You see yourself as a poor man whose master has stripped him of his livery. You are only a sinner! And you understand the nakedness felt by our first parents.
﻿—﻿You should be weeping all the time. And you have wept. You have suffered a great deal. And yet you are very happy. You wouldn’t change places with anyone. For many years now you have not lost your gaudium cum pace ﻿—﻿ your peaceful joy. You thank God for this and would like to let everyone into the secret of your happiness.
