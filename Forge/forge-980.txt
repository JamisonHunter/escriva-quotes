Through your Christian doctrine, your upright life and your work well done, you have to give good example to the people around you ﻿—﻿ relatives, friends, colleagues, neighbours, pupils ﻿—﻿ in the way you carry out your profession and fulfil the duties your job entails. You cannot be a shoddy worker.
