Be grateful to God from the bottom of your heart for those wonderful and awesome faculties he chose to give you when he made you ﻿—﻿ your intellect and your will. They are wonderful, because they make you like him; and awesome because there are human beings who turn their faculties against their Creator.
It seems to me we could sum up the thankfulness that we owe as children of God by saying to this Father of ours, now and always, serviam!: I will serve you!
