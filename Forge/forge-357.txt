357
Tell Our Lord constantly and sincerely that you desire to be a saint and to do apostolateâ€¦ Then the poor vessel of your soul will not get broken. And should it do so, it will be put together again and acquire an added attractiveness, and it will continue to be of use for your sanctity and the apostolate.
