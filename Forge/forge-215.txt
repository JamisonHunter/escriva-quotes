Virgin Immaculate, my Mother!, do not abandon me. See how my poor heart is filled with tears. ﻿—﻿ I do not want to offend my God!
﻿—﻿I already know, and I trust I shall never forget, that I am worth nothing. My smallness and my loneliness weigh upon me so much! But… I am not alone. You, Sweet Lady, and my Father God will never leave me.
