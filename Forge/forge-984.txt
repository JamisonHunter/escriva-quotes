As well as having given you abundant and effective grace, the Lord has given you a brain, a pair of hands and intellectual powers so that your talents may yield fruit.
God wants to work miracles all the time ﻿—﻿ to raise the dead, make the deaf hear, restore sight to the blind, enable the lame to walk… ﻿—﻿ through your sanctified professional work, which you will have turned into a holocaust that is both pleasing to God and useful to souls.
