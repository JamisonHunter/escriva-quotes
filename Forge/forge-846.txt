Constantly call to mind that at every moment you are cooperating in the human and spiritual formation of those around you, and of all souls ﻿—﻿ for the blessed Communion of Saints reaches as far as that. At every moment: when you work and when you rest; when people see you happy or when they see you worried; when at your job, or out in the middle of the street, you pray as does a child of God and the peace of your soul shows through; when people see that you have suffered, that you have wept, and you smile.
