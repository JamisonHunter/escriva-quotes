You insist on trying to walk on your own, doing your own will, guided solely by your own judgement… And you can see for yourself that the fruit of this is fruitlessness.
My child, if you don’t give up your own judgement, if you are proud, if you devote yourself to “your” apostolate, you will work all night ﻿—﻿ your whole life will be one long night ﻿—﻿and at the end of it all the dawn will find you with your nets empty.
