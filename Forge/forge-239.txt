239
We read in the Gospel that the Magi, videntes stellam ﻿—﻿ when they saw the star ﻿—﻿ were filled with great joy.
﻿—﻿They rejoiced, my son, they were immensely glad, because they had done what they were supposed to do; and they rejoiced because they knew for certain they would reach the King, who never abandons those who seek him.
