My Father ﻿—﻿ talk to him like that, confidently ﻿—﻿ who art in heaven, look upon me with compassionate Love, and make me respond to thy love.
﻿—﻿Melt and enkindle my heart of bronze, burn and purify my unmortified flesh, fill my mind with supernatural light, make my tongue proclaim the Love and Glory of Christ.
