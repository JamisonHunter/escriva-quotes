131
It would be a false charity, a diabolical, deceitful charity, to give way in matters of faith. We must be fortes in fide ﻿—﻿ strong in faith, firm, as Saint Peter demands.
﻿—﻿This is not fanaticism, but quite simply the practice of our faith. It does not entail disliking anyone. We can give way in all accidental matters, but in matters of faith we cannot give way. We cannot spare the oil from our lamps, otherwise when the Bridegroom comes he will find they have burned out.
