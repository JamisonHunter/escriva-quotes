With our acts of service we can prepare an even greater triumph for the Lord than that of his entry into Jerusalem. For there will be no repetition of the Judas episode, or that of the Garden of Gethsemane, or of that dark night. We will succeed in setting the world alight with the flames of that fire which he came to cast upon the earth! And the light of Truth ﻿—﻿ which is our Jesus ﻿—﻿ will enlighten men’s minds in an unending day.
