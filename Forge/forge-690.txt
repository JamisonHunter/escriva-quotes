My daughter, you have set up a home. I like to remind you that you women ﻿—﻿ as you well know ﻿—﻿ have a great strength, which you know how to enfold within a special gentleness, so that it is not noticed. With that strength, you can make your husband and children instruments of God, or demons.
﻿—﻿You will always make them instruments of God: he is counting on your help.
