I want to warn you against a difficulty that may arise: it is the temptation of weariness and discouragement.
﻿—﻿Isn’t it still fresh in your memory what life ﻿—﻿ your old life ﻿—﻿ used to be like, with no aim to it, no purpose, no sparkle, and then, with God’s light and your own dedication, a new direction was given to it and you were filled with joy?
