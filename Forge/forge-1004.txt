“So you are a king?”… Yes, Christ is the King, the King who not only grants you an audience whenever you like, but even in the madness of his love “gives up” ﻿—﻿ you know what I mean ﻿—﻿ his magnificent palace in Heaven, which you cannot yet reach, and waits for you in the Tabernacle.
﻿—﻿Don’t you think it is absurd not to hurry to speak to him, and not to do so more assiduously?
