“There is the daily pressure upon me of my anxiety for all the churches”, Saint Paul wrote. This sigh of the Apostle is a reminder for all Christians ﻿—﻿ for you, too ﻿—﻿ of our responsibility to place at the feet of the Spouse of Christ, of the Holy Church, all that we are and all that we can do; loving her most faithfully, even at the cost of fortune, of honour, and of life.
