889
At times, in their behaviour, some Christians don’t give the commandment of charity the full scope and value it has. In that last wonderful discourse of his, we find Christ surrounded by his chosen ones and leaving them these words as a form of testament: Mandatum novum do vobis, ut diligatis invicem ﻿—﻿ a new commandment I give to you, that you love one another.
Then he went further: In hoc cognoscent omnes quia discipuli mei estis ﻿—﻿ by this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.
