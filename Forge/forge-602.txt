Thank Jesus for the confidence he gives you! It’s not stubbornness, but God’s light that makes you firm as a rock. Meanwhile, others, good as they are, present a sorry picture. They seem to be sinking in the sand… They lack the foundation of the faith.
Ask Our Lord to grant that the demands of the virtue of faith may be met both in your life and in the lives of others.
