The Gospel tells us that Jesus, after he had worked the miracle, when they wanted to crown him king, hid himself.
﻿—﻿Lord, you make us share in the miracle of the Eucharist. We beg you not to hide away. Live with us. May we see you, may we touch you, may we feel you. May we want to be beside you all the time, and have you as the King of our lives and of our work.
