Aquae multae non potuerunt exstinguere caritatem!! ﻿—﻿ the great turmoil of waters could not quench the fire of charity. ﻿—﻿I offer you two interpretations of these words of Holy Scripture. ﻿—﻿First: the throng of your past sins, now that you have fully repented of them, will not take you away from the Love of our God; and a second one: the waters of misunderstanding, the difficulties that you are perhaps encountering, should not interrupt your apostolic work.
