356
The first Apostles, when Our Lord called them, were by the side of an old boat busy mending the torn nets. Our Lord told them to follow him and statim ﻿—﻿ immediately ﻿—﻿ relictis omnibus ﻿—﻿ they left everything ﻿—﻿ everything! And followed him…
And it does happen sometimes that we, who wish to imitate them, don’t quite leave everything, and there remains some attachment in our heart, something wrong in our life which we’re not willing to break with and offer up to God.
