1017
I was saying to you that even people who had not received baptism were moved when they were telling me, “I can well understand that saintly souls must be happy, for they look at events with a vision that is above the things of this world. They see things with the eyes of eternity.”
May you not lack that same vision, I added afterwards, so that you can respond to the special love with which the Blessed Trinity has treated you.
