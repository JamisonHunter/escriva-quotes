Grant me, Jesus, the Cross with no Simon of Cyrene to help me. No, that’s not right; I need your grace, I need your help here as in everything. You must be my Simon of Cyrene. With you, my God, no trial can daunt me…
﻿—﻿But what if my Cross should consist in boredom or sadness? ﻿—﻿ In that case I say to you, Lord, with You I would gladly be sad.
