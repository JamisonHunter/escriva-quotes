When our vision is clouded, when our eyes have lost their clarity, we need to go to the light. And Jesus Christ has told us that he is the Light of the world and that he has come to heal the sick.
﻿—﻿That is why your weaknesses and your falls ﻿—﻿ when God allows them ﻿—﻿ should not separate you from Christ, but rather draw you closer to him!
