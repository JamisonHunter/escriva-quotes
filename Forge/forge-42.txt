42
Desire nothing for yourself, either good or bad. For yourself, want only what God wants.
Whatever it may be, if it comes from his hand, from God, however bad it may appear in the eyes of men, with God’s help it will appear good, yes very good!, to you. And with an ever-increasing conviction you will say: Et in tribulatione mea dilatasti me… et calix tuus inebrians, quam praeclarus est! ﻿—﻿ I have rejoiced in tribulation…, how marvellous is your chalice. It inebriates my whole being!
