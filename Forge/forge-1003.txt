Saint Teresa assures us that “anyone who doesn’t pray doesn’t need any devil to tempt him; while whoever prays, even if only for a quarter of an hour each day, will necessarily be saved.” This is because our conversation with Our Lord ﻿—﻿ who is so loving, even in times of difficulty or dryness of soul ﻿—﻿enables us to see things in their proper perspective and discover the true proportions of life.
Be a soul of prayer.
