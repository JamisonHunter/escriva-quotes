Continue thinking about the donkey’s good qualities and notice how in order to do anything worth while, it has to allow itself to be ruled by the will of whoever is leading it… On its own the donkey would only… make an ass of itself. Probably the brightest thing that would occur to it to do would be to roll over on the ground, trot to the manger and start braying.
“Dear Jesus”, you too should say to him, “ut iumentum factus sum apud te! ﻿—﻿ you have made me be your little donkey. Please don’t leave me: et ego semper tecum! ﻿—﻿ and I will stay with you always. Lead me, tightly harnessed by your grace: Tenuisti manum dexteram meam… ﻿—﻿ you have led me by the halter; et in voluntate tua deduxisti me… ﻿—﻿ make me do your Will. And so I will love you for ever and ever ﻿—﻿ et cum gloria suscepisti me! ”
