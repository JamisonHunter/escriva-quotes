637
In your work with souls ﻿—﻿ and all your activity should be work with souls ﻿—﻿ be filled with faith, with hope, with love, because all the difficulties will be overcome.
To confirm this truth for us, the Psalmist wrote: Et tu, Domine, deridebis eos: ad nihilum deduces omnes gentes ﻿—﻿ You, O Lord, will laugh at them: You will bring them to nothing.
