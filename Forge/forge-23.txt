23
A red and blue wave of filth and corruption has set out to overcome the world, throwing its vile spittle over the Cross of the Redeemer.
Now He wants another wave to issue out from our souls ﻿—﻿ a wave that’s white and powerful, like the Lord’s right hand ﻿—﻿ to overcome with its purity all the rottenness of materialism and undo the corruption that has flooded the world. It is for this, and more, that the children of God have come.
