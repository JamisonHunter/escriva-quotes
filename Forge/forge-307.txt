307
Pray resolutely using the words of the Psalmist: “Lord, you are my refuge and my strength, I trust in thee!”
I promise you that he will preserve you from the ambushes of the “noontide devil”, when you are tempted and… even when you fall, and when your age and virtues ought to have proved solid and you should have known by heart that He alone is your Strength.
