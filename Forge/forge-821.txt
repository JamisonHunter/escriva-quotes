Work with humility. I mean, count first on God’s blessings, which will not fail you. Then, on your good desires, on your work plans ﻿—﻿ and on your difficulties! Do not forget that among those difficulties you must always include your own lack of holiness.
﻿—﻿You will be a good instrument if every day you struggle to be better.
