Following the Masterâ€™s wishes, you are to be salt and light while being fully immersed in this world we were made to live in, sharing in all human activities. Light which illuminates the hearts and minds of men. Salt which gives flavour and preserves from corruption.
That is why if you lack apostolic zeal you will become insipid and useless. You will be letting other people down and your life will be absurd.
