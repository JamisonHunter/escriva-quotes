If we join our own little things, those insignificant or big difficulties of ours, to the great sufferings of Our Lord, the Victim (He is the only Victim!), their value will increase. They will become a treasure, and then we will take up the Cross of Christ gladly and with style.
﻿—﻿And then every suffering will soon be overcome: nobody, nothing at all, will be able to take away our peace and our joy.
