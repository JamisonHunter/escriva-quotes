The solution is to love. Saint John the Apostle wrote some words which really move me: qui autem timet, non est perfectus in caritate. I like to translate them as follows, almost word for word ﻿—﻿ the fearful man doesn’t know how to love.
﻿—﻿You, therefore, who do love and know how to show it, you mustn’t be afraid of anything. So, on you go!
