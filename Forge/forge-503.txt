Love Our Lord passionately. Love him madly! Because if there is love there ﻿—﻿ when there is love ﻿—﻿ I would dare to say that resolutions are not needed. My parents ﻿—﻿ think of yours ﻿—﻿ did not need to make any resolutions to love me: and what an effusion of tenderness they showed me, in little details every day!
With that same human heart we can and should love God.
