Sincerely examine the way you are following the Master. Consider whether you might have given yourself in a dry, official way, with a faith that has no sparkle to it; if there is no humility or sacrifice, nor daily work; if you are all façade and pay no attention to the details of each moment… In a word, if you lack Love.
If this is the case, your ineffectiveness should come as no surprise to you. React right away, and be led by the hand of Our Lady.
