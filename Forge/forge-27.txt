27
I look at your Cross, my Jesus, and I rejoice in your grace, because your Calvary has won for us the reward of the Holy Spirit. And you give yourself to me, each day, lovingly, madly, in the Sacred Host. And you have made me a son of God, and have given me your Mother to be mine.
I canâ€™t be satisfied with just giving thanks. My thoughts take flight: Lord, Lord, there are so many souls who are so far from you!
