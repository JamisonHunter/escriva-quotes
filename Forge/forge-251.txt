You said to me: “I seem not only unable to go ahead along my way, but also unable to be saved without a miracle of grace. Oh, my poor soul! I remain cold and, what is worse, almost indifferent. It’s as if I were an outsider looking at ‘a case’ (mine) which had nothing to do with him. Will these days turn out to be completely futile?
And nevertheless, my Mother is my Mother and Jesus is ﻿—﻿ dare I say it? ﻿—﻿ my Jesus. And there are good and saintly souls, at this very moment, praying for me.”
