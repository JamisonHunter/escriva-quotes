It was you who wrote what I am now copying out: “Domine, tu scis quia amo te! ﻿—﻿ Lord, you know that I love you! How very often, Jesus, I repeat again and again those words your dear Cephas uttered, as a bitter-sweet litany. For I know that I love you, and yet I am so very unsure of myself that I cannot bring myself to say it to you clearly. There are so many denials in my wicked life. Tu scis, Domine! ﻿—﻿ You know that I love you! ﻿—﻿ May my actions, Jesus, never go against these yearnings of my heart.”
﻿—﻿Keep up this prayer of yours and he will certainly hear you.
