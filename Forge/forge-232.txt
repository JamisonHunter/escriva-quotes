My son, you can do nothing on the supernatural level through your own strength; whereas when you become God’s instrument you can do everything. Omnia possum in eo qui me confortat! ﻿—﻿ I can do all things in him who strengthens me. For in his goodness he wishes to use inadequate instruments, like you and like me.
