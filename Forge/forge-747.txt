A priest who was saying the Divine Office prepared himself for prayer in this way: ‘I will follow the rule of saying, when I start: “I want to pray as the saints pray”, and then I will invite my Guardian Angel to sing the Lord’s praises with me.’
Try this in your own vocal prayer, and also as a way of increasing your presence of God in your work.
