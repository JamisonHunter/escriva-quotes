Men lie when they say “forever” in temporal matters. The only true “forever”, in the complete sense, is the forever of eternity.
﻿—﻿And that is the way you have to live, with a faith that brings a foretaste of the sweet honey of Heaven whenever you think about that eternity which is truly everlasting.
