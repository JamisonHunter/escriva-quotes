You don’t know whether you are making progress, nor how much… But what use is such a reckoning to you?…
﻿—﻿What is important is that you should persevere, that your heart should be on fire, that you should see more light and wider horizons; that you should work hard for our intentions, that you should feel them as your own ﻿—﻿ even though you don’t know what they are ﻿—﻿ and that you should pray for all of them.
