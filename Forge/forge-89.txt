In living holy purity and a clean life, there is a great difficulty to which we are all exposed. The danger is one of becoming bourgeois, either in our spiritual life or in our professional life; the danger ﻿—﻿ also a real one for those called by God to marriage ﻿—﻿ of becoming dry old bachelors, selfish; people who do not love.
﻿—﻿Fight that danger tooth and nail, without making concessions of any kind.
