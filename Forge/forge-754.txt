When you open the Holy Gospel, think that what is written there ﻿—﻿ the words and deeds of Christ ﻿—﻿ is something that you should not only know, but live. Everything, every point that is told there, has been gathered, detail by detail, for you to make it come alive in the individual circumstances of your life.
﻿—﻿God has called us Catholics to follow him closely. In that holy Writing you will find the Life of Jesus, but you should also find your own life.
