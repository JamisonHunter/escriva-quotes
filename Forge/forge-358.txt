Your prayer should be that of a child of God, and not that of the hypocrites who will hear from Jesus’ lips: “Not every one who says to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.”
Your prayer, your clamour of “Lord, Lord” should be linked in a thousand different ways throughout the day to a desire and an effective effort to fulfil the Will of God.
