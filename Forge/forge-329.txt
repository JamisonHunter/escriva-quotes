329
A foolish child wails and stamps his feet when his loving mother puts a needle to his finger to get a splinter out… A sensible child, perhaps with his eyes full of tears ﻿—﻿ for the flesh is weak ﻿—﻿ looks gratefully at his good mother who is making him suffer a little in order to avoid much greater harm.
﻿—﻿Jesus, may I be a sensible child.
