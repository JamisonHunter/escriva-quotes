We can never be content with what we are doing to serve our God, just as an artist is never satisfied with the painting or statue he is working on. Everyone tells him how marvellous it is, but he thinks: “No. It isn’t quite right. I wanted it to be better.” This is how we should feel.
Moreover, the Lord has given us so much. He has a right to the very best from us… and we must go at his pace.
