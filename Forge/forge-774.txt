“I carry a little Crucifix”, wrote a friend. “Its Crucified is worn out by use and by kisses . It was left to my father when his mother, who had used it, died.
It’s a poor thing and much the worse for wear, so I would not have the nerve to give it away to anyone. That’s why when I see it my love for the Cross will grow.”
