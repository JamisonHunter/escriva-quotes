Christian optimism is not a sugary optimism; nor is it a mere human confidence that everything will turn out all right.
It is an optimism that sinks its roots in an awareness of our freedom, and in the sure knowledge of the power of grace. It is an optimism which leads us to make demands on ourselves, to struggle to respond at every moment to Godâ€™s calls.
