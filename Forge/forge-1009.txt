1009
Whenever the worrying thought enters your head that you lack rectitude of intention ﻿—﻿ sometimes it may come like a flash of lightning, at other times like a filthy pestering fly which you brush off but which keeps coming back ﻿—﻿ always make acts of the opposite virtue straight away… and carry on working calmly for Him and with Him.
﻿—﻿At the same time, even though you might feel you are only pronouncing the words mechanically, say slowly: Lord, I want nothing for myself. May everything be for your glory and for your Love.
