257
Faced by apparent sterility in your apostolate you begin to detect the first waves of discouragement, which your faith rejects quite firmly. ﻿—﻿ But you realise that you need a more humble, lively and operative faith.
As someone who longs to bring health to souls, you should cry out like the father of that sick boy possessed by the devil: Domine, adiuva incredulitatem meam! ﻿—﻿ Lord, help my unbelief!
