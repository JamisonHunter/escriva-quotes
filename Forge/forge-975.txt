In the campaigns against the Church there are many organizations which conspire together, sometimes going hand in hand with those who call themselves good. They influence people through newspapers, leaflets, satire, calumnies and spoken propaganda. They then take people where they wish ﻿—﻿ to hell itself. They try to turn people into an amorphous mass, as if they had no soul. They are a pitiful sight.
However, since people do have souls, we have to snatch them out of the claws of these organizations of evil and place them at the service of God.
