901
No son or daughter of Holy Church can lead a quiet life, without concern for the anonymous masses ﻿—﻿ a mob, a herd, a flock, as I once wrote. How many noble passions they have within their apparent listlessness! How much potential!
We must serve all, laying our hands on each and every one, as Jesus did, singulis manus imponens, to bring them back to life, to enlighten their minds and strengthen their wills: so that they can become useful!
