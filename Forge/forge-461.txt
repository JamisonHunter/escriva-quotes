Your love for Mother Church and the service you render her should in no way be conditioned by the greater or lesser holiness of the individuals who make up the Church, even though we ardently desire that everyone will achieve Christian perfection.
﻿—﻿You have to love the Spouse of Christ, your Mother. She is, and always will be, pure and spotless.
