403
We need to smooth off the rough edges a little more each day ﻿—﻿ just as if we were working in stone or wood ﻿—﻿ and get rid of the defects in our own lives with a spirit of penance. And with small mortifications, which are of two types: active mortifications ﻿—﻿ the ones we ourselves look for, like little flowers we gather up during the course of the day ﻿—﻿ and passive mortifications, which come from outside and we find difficult to accept. Jesus Christ will later make up for whatever is still lacking.
﻿—﻿What a wonderful figure of the crucified Christ you will become if generously and cheerfully you give your all!
