I see myself like a poor little bird, accustomed only to making short flights from tree to tree, or, at most, up to a third floor balconyâ€¦ One day in its life it succeeded in reaching the roof of a modest building, that you could hardly call a skyscraper.
But suddenly our little bird is snatched up by an eagle, who mistakes the bird for one of its own brood. In its powerful talons the bird is borne higher and higher, above the mountains of the earth and the snow-capped peaks, above the white, blue and rose-pink clouds, and higher and higher until it can look right into the sun. And then the eagle lets go of the little bird and says: Off you go. Fly!
