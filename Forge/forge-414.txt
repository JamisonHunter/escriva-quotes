There is a Spanish saying which speaks clearly enough: Entre santa y santo, pared de cal y canto (“Twixt holy man and holy maid, a wall of solid stone be laid”).
﻿—﻿We have to watch over our hearts and our senses, and pull ourselves away from all occasions of sin. No matter how holy it may appear, passion must not have its way!
