I understood you very well when you ended up saying: “Quite honestly, I haven’t even made the grade of being a donkey ﻿—﻿ the donkey that was the throne of Jesus when he entered Jerusalem. I’m just part of a disgusting heap of dirty tatters that the poorest rag-picker would ignore.”
But I told you: all the same, God has chosen you and wants you to be his instrument. So your wretchedness ﻿—﻿ which is a genuine fact ﻿—﻿ should turn into one more reason for you to be thankful to God for calling you.
