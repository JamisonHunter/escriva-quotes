Is it possible, you asked me, that Christ should have spent so many years ﻿—﻿ twenty centuries ﻿—﻿ acting on earth, and the world should be now what it is? Is it possible, you went on, that there should still be people who do not know Our Lord?
﻿—﻿And I answered you with conviction: It is our fault. For we have been called to be co-redeemers, and at times, perhaps often!, we do not follow the Will of God.
