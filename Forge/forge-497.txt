God loves me… And John the Apostle writes: “Let us love God, then, since God loved us first.” ﻿—﻿As if this were not enough, Jesus comes to each one of us, in spite of our patent wretchedness, to ask us, as he asked Peter: “Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these others?…”
﻿—﻿This is the moment to reply: “Lord, you know all things, you know that I love you!” adding, with humility, “Help me to love you more. Increase my love!”
