“My God, my God! All of them were equally loved, through you, in you and with you, and now they are all scattered.” Thus you complained when you saw yourself once again all alone and lacking in human resources.
﻿—﻿But Our Lord immediately made you feel sure in your soul that He would sort it out. And you said to him: “You will fix everything.”
