7
A day of salvation, of eternity, has come for us. Once again the call of the Divine Shepherd can be heard, those affectionate words: Vocavi te nomine tuo ﻿—﻿ I have called you by your name.
Just like our mother, he calls us by our name, even by the name we were affectionately called at home. ﻿—﻿There, in the depths of our soul, he calls us and we just have to answer: Ecce ego quia vocasti me ﻿—﻿here I am, for you have called me, and this time I’m determined not to let time flow by like water over rounded stones, leaving no trace behind.
