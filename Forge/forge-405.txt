405
Draw close to Jesus who has died for you; draw close to that Cross, outlined against the sky on the summit of Golgothaâ€¦
But draw close sincerely and with interior recollection, which is the sign of Christian maturity. That way the divine and human events of the Passion will sink deep into your soul.
