Pray to God that in the Holy Church, our Mother, the hearts of all may be one heart, as they were in the earliest times of Christianity; so that the words of Scripture may be truly fulfilled until the end of the ages: Multitudinis autem credentium erat cor unum et anima una ﻿—﻿ the company of the faithful were of one heart and one soul.
﻿—﻿I am saying this to you in all seriousness: may this holy unity not come to any harm through you. Take it to your prayer!
