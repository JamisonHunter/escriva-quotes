I do not know how it strikes you…, but I feel I must tell you how moved I am whenever I read the words of the prophet Isaiah: Ego vocavi te nomine tuo, meus es tu! ﻿—﻿ I have called you, I have brought you into my Church, you are mine! God himself telling me I am his! It is enough to make one go mad with Love!
