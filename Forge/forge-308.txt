308
Do you think people are grateful for services rendered only reluctantly? Evidently not. You might even say it would have been better not to have bothered.
﻿—﻿And yet you think you can serve God with sour looks? No! ﻿—﻿ You have to serve him cheerfully, in spite of your wretchedness, which we will be able to get rid of with God’s grace.
