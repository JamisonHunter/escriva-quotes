A spirit of penance is to be found first of all in taking advantage of the many trifling occasions ﻿—﻿ deeds, renunciations, sacrifices, services rendered… ﻿—﻿ which we find daily along our way and we then convert into acts of love and contrition, into mortifications. In this way we shall be able to gather a bouquet at the end of each day ﻿—﻿ a fine bunch of flowers which we can offer to God!
