We can say with Saint Augustine that our evil passions tug at our garments, dragging us down. At the same time we are aware of great, noble and pure ambitions within our hearts, and know that a struggle is going on.
﻿—﻿If, with the grace of God, you make use of the ascetical means: if you seek to have presence of God, if you look for mortification and ﻿—﻿ don’t be afraid ﻿—﻿ penance, then you will make progress, you will find peace and victory will be yours.
