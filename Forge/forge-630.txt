I would like ﻿—﻿ help me with your prayer ﻿—﻿ all of us within Holy Church to feel that we are members of the same body, as the Apostle asks of us. I would like us to be vividly and profoundly aware, without any lack of interest, of the joys, the troubles, the progress of our Mother who is one, holy, catholic, apostolic, Roman.
I would like us to live in unison with one another and all of us with Christ.
