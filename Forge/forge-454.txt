How very insistent the Apostle Saint John was in preaching the mandatum novum, the new commandment that we should love one another!
﻿—﻿I would fall on my knees, without putting on any act ﻿—﻿ but this is what my heart dictates ﻿—﻿ and ask you, for the love of God, to love one another, to help one another, to lend one another a hand, to know how to forgive one another.
