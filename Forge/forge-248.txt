“When Herod heard this,” (that the King had come to this earth), “he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.”
This is an everyday occurrence! We see the same thing happening now. In the face of God’s greatness, which shows itself in a thousand ways, there are always some people ﻿—﻿ sometimes even in positions of authority ﻿—﻿ who are troubled. It’s because they do not love God; because they have no real wish to meet him; because they don’t want to follow his inspirations, and so they become obstacles in God’s path.
