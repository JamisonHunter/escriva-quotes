Sancta Maria, Stella maris ﻿—﻿ Holy Mary, Star of the sea, be our guide.
Make this firm request, because there is no storm which can shipwreck the most Sweet Heart of Mary. When you see the storm coming, if you get into that firm Refuge which is Mary, there will be no danger of your wavering or going down.
