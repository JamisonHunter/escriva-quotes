102
Peace, and the joy which comes with it, cannot be given by the world.
﻿—﻿Men are forever “making peace” and forever getting entangled in wars. This is because they have forgotten the advice to struggle inside themselves and to go to God for help. Then He will conquer, and we will obtain peace for ourselves and for ﻿—﻿ our own homes, for society and for the world.
