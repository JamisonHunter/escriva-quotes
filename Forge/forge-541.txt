In the Holy Sacrifice of the altar, the priest takes up the Body of our God, and the Chalice containing his Blood, and raises them above all the things of the earth, saying: Per Ipsum, et cum Ipso, et in Ipso ﻿—﻿ through My Love, with My Love, in My Love!
Unite yourself to the action of the priest. Or rather, make that reality a part of your life.
