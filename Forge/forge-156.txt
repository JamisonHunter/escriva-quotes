Sanctity has the flexibility of supple muscles. Whoever wishes to be a saint should know how to behave so that while he does something that involves a mortification for him, he omits doing something else ﻿—﻿ as long as this does not offend God ﻿—﻿ which he would also find difficult, and thanks the Lord for this comfort. If we Christians were to act otherwise we would run the risk of becoming stiff and lifeless, like a rag doll.
Sanctity is not rigid like cardboard; it knows how to smile, to give way to others and to hope. It is life ﻿—﻿ a supernatural life.
