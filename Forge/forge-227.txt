227
Turn to Our Lady ﻿—﻿ the Mother, Daughter and Spouse of God, and our Mother ﻿—﻿ and ask her to obtain more graces for you from the Blessed Trinity: the grace of faith, of hope, of love and of contrition. So that when it seems that a harsh dry wind is blowing in your life, threatening to wither those flowers of your soul, they will not wither… and neither will those of your brothers.
