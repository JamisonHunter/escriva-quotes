673
We can never attribute to ourselves the power of Jesus who is passing by amongst us. Our Lord is passing by: and he transforms souls when we come close to him with one heart, one feeling, one desire: to be good Christians. But it is he who does it: not you nor I. It is Christ who is passing by!
﻿—﻿And then he stays in our hearts ﻿—﻿ in yours and in mine! ﻿—﻿ and in our tabernacles.
