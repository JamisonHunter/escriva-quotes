The work of the Church, each day, is a great fabric which we offer to God: because all of us who are baptised are the Church.
﻿—﻿If we carry out our tasks faithfully and selflessly, this great fabric will be beautiful and flawless. But if someone loosens a thread here, someone else a thread there, and another somewhere else… instead of a beautiful fabric we will have a tattered rag.
